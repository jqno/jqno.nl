Verslag

<p>
Karel and I went to the Eindhoven concert yesterday. We were supposed
to meet Klaus, but unfortunately he couldn't make it, as you all know.
We did have a very good time, the band plays the songs very well.
</p>

<p>
The setlist was exactly the same as the one posted here earlier,
although they didn't play Dr Tarr, unfortunately.
</p>

<p>
It was fun to watch Steve juggling his drum sticks. One time, he
almost didn't catch it, and John saw it happen. They had a good laugh
about it.
</p>

<p>
Alan mentioned on stage that he had had dinner before the show with
the guy who organises the Night of the Proms concerts each year, and
that he would show him how his songs are played with orchestra and
choir. Unfortunately he didn't have an orchestra with him, but he did
have a choir: the audience. So we rehearsed the "freedom, freedom" bit
from Breakdown, and performed it. It was fun :).
BTW, Alan having dinner with the NotP-guy, does that mean that he
might be at next year's edition of Night of the Proms? That would be
nice :). They could have John Miles sing a couple of songs with them
:).
</p>

<p>
During the encore, the entire audience was singing along with Old &
Wise. That was a great moment. They ended with an energetic rendition
of Games People Play, again with a large portion of the crowd singing
along. Really nice.
</p>

<p>
When the concert was over, I left quickly, to catch my train, go home
and get some sleep. I haven't been to the Police, but I did go to the
Symforce festival in Tilburg the day before (which was great, BTW: I
saw Focus, Riverside, Pendragon and the Flower Kings, and those were
just 4 of the 11 bands that were there). So, altogether, a great
weekend :).

P.S. Can anybody please explain Alan's coat? He looked like a giant
bell boy in need of a haircut :).
